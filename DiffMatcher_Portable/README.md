# DiffMatcher üîç

A comprehensive file comparison tool that compares files line by line and provides detailed similarity analysis. Built around your original file comparison snippet with both GUI and command-line interfaces. **Now supports Microsoft Word documents (.docx)!**

## Features ‚ú®

- **Line-by-line comparison** using Python's `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
- **üìÑ Microsoft Word document support** (.docx files) with automatic text extraction
- **Multiple file format support** - text files, code files, and Word documents
- **Graphical User Interface** with tkinter for easy file selection and visual results
- **Command-line interface** for automation and scripting
- **Detailed similarity analysis** with percentage scores
- **Visual diff highlighting** showing exactly which lines differ
- **Sample file generation** for testing and demonstration (including Word docs)
- **Progress tracking** and status updates
- **Mixed file type comparison** (e.g., compare .txt with .docx)

## Installation üöÄ

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the optional dependency for Word document support:
   ```bash
   pip install python-docx
   ```
3. Run the applications directly

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd DiffMatcher

# Option 1: Auto-detect best Python (recommended)
python launch_gui.py

# Option 2: Run GUI directly
python diff_matcher.py

# Option 3: Run with Word support (if using virtual environment)
start_gui.bat

# Run the CLI version
python cli_diff_matcher.py --help
```

### üîß **Troubleshooting Word Document Support**

If you get an error about `python-docx` not being installed:

**Option A: Install globally**
```bash
pip install python-docx
```

**Option B: Use the project's virtual environment**
```bash
# Windows
start_gui.bat
# or
python launch_gui.py
```

**Option C: Manual virtual environment setup**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install python-docx
python diff_matcher.py
```

1. **Launch the application:**
   ```bash
   python diff_matcher.py
   ```

2. **Select files to compare:**
   - Click "Browse" buttons to select your files
   - Or use "Create Sample Files" to generate test files

3. **Compare files:**
   - Click "Compare Files" button
   - View detailed results in the results panel

4. **Features:**
   - Visual progress indication
   - Detailed line-by-line differences
   - Overall similarity percentage
   - Clear and intuitive interface

### Command Line Interface (`cli_diff_matcher.py`)

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Compare two files
python cli_diff_matcher.py file1.txt file2.txt

# Compare with minimal output
python cli_diff_matcher.py file1.txt file2.txt --quiet

# Create and compare sample files
python cli_diff_matcher.py --sample
```

#### Command Line Options
- `file1 file2` - Two files to compare (supports .txt, .py, .docx, etc.)

- `--sample, -s` - Create sample files and compare them
- `--version, -v` - Show version information
- `--help, -h` - Show help message

#### Exit Codes
- `0` - Files are nearly identical (‚â•95% similarity)
- `1` - Files have differences but are similar (‚â•50% similarity)
- `2` - Files are significantly different (<50% similarity)
- `3` - Error occurred during comparison

## Word Document Features üìÑ

### What's Supported
- ‚úÖ **Text extraction** from .docx files
- ‚úÖ **Paragraph comparison** line by line
- ‚úÖ **Mixed file type comparison** (e.g., .txt vs .docx)
- ‚úÖ **Table content extraction** (if no paragraphs found)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic sample generation** for both text and Word formats

### How It Works
1. **Text Extraction**: Uses `python-docx` to extract text from Word documents
2. **Paragraph Processing**: Each paragraph becomes a line for comparison
3. **Table Handling**: If no paragraphs are found, text from tables is extracted
4. **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Same algorithm as text files, applied to extracted content

### Word Document Comparison Examples

**Creating Word document samples:**
```bash
python cli_diff_matcher.py --sample
# Creates both .txt and .docx versions for testing
```

**Comparing Word documents:**
```bash
python cli_diff_matcher.py document1.docx document2.docx
```

**Comparing text with Word document:**
```bash
python cli_diff_matcher.py report.txt report.docx
```

**Word document demonstration:**
```bash
python word_demo.py
# Creates complex Word documents and shows detailed comparison
```

### Limitations
- Only `.docx` format is supported (not `.doc`)
- Images, charts, and complex formatting are ignored
- Only text content is compared
- Requires `python-docx` library installation

## Core Algorithm üßÆ

The application uses Python's `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to calculate similarity ratios for each line:

```python
similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, line1, line2).ratio()
```

**Similarity interpretation:**
- **‚â•95%**: Files are nearly identical ‚úÖ
- **‚â•80%**: Files are quite similar with some differences ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **‚â•50%**: Files have moderate similarity üî∂
- **<50%**: Files are significantly different ‚ùå
